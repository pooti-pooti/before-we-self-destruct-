### NOTE!: Still at the beginning stage of development, but it works.

This php file can be used to send messages the user can read and then delete. <br> 
You can't stop someone else from seeing it if they had the link, but they can't stop you from knowing about it, because anytime someone reads the message, you will have their IP address.


## Requirements

1 - GNU/Linux
2 - LAMP STACK , Linux, Apache2, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin
